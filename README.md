# Lemmings

A browser tribute to the classic Lemmings, implemented as a single self-contained
HTML file with zero dependencies — no build step, no assets, no network calls
(apart from one Google Font). Terrain, sprites, particles, and sound effects are
all generated procedurally at runtime.

## Play

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve it locally:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8000   # then visit http://localhost:8000
```

> Note: Chrome suppresses `requestAnimationFrame` for background tabs, so the
> game only runs while its tab is focused.

## How to play

Guide lemmings from the entrance hatch to the exit. They walk mindlessly,
turn at walls, and die from long falls (>62px). Select an ability, then click
a lemming to assign it. Save at least the required number before time runs out.

| Ability | Effect |
|---|---|
| Climber | Climbs vertical walls (permanent) |
| Floater | Survives any fall (permanent) |
| Bomber | Explodes after 5 seconds, blasting a crater |
| Blocker | Stands still and turns others around |
| Builder | Builds a 12-step diagonal bridge |
| Basher | Digs horizontally |
| Digger | Digs straight down |
| Miner | Digs diagonally down |

Steel (grey, riveted) is indestructible — bashers, diggers, miners and bombers
all stop at it.

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Click ability, then click lemming | Assign ability |
| Right-click | Deselect ability (and disarm a pending nuke) |
| `1`–`8` | Select ability |
| `P` / `Space` | Pause |
| `F` | Fast-forward (3×) |
| `N` | Nuke — **press twice** to confirm (arms every lemming as a bomber) |
| `R` | Restart the current level |
| `M` | Mute |
| `-` / `=` | Release rate down / up |
| `←` / `→` or `A` / `D` | Scroll the viewport |
| Mouse at screen edge, or click minimap | Scroll |

The nuke is instant and irreversible, so — like the original — it takes a
confirming second press (`Esc` or right-click cancels a pending nuke).

Five levels, unlocked in order; progress persists in `localStorage`. Each level
also remembers your best save count — shown on the level-select and results
screens, with a "NEW BEST!" callout when you beat it — so there's a target to
chase for a 100% run.

The layout is responsive: it fills the window up to 960px wide and reflows down
to phone widths (the ability bar wraps onto its own row), so it stays fully
usable on small screens instead of being clipped.

## Tests

A zero-dependency test suite drives the game logic headlessly (Node `vm` with
DOM stubs). Scripted bots play every level's intended solution end-to-end —
proving each level is actually winnable (level 5's gauntlet is verified
traversable) — alongside per-skill physics scenarios and UI/persistence checks:

```sh
node tests/run-tests.mjs   # Node 18+
```

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how the engine works internally.

## Repository layout

- `index.html` — the entire game
- `tests/run-tests.mjs` — headless test suite
- `reference/Lemmings.ts/` — third-party TypeScript Lemmings remake
  ([Tobias Wirth's Lemmings.ts](https://github.com/tomsoftware/Lemmings.ts), MIT-style;
  see its own LICENSE), kept for behavioral reference only — not used by the game
